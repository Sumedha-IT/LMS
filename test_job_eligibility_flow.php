echo "=== Job Eligibility Data Flow Test ===\n\n";

echo "1. REQUIRED DATA FLOW:\n";
echo "   ┌─────────────────┐\n";
echo "   │ 1. Create Course │\n";
echo "   └─────────┬───────┘\n";
echo "             │\n";
echo "   ┌─────────▼───────┐\n";
echo "   │ 2. Create Batch │ ← Links to course via course_id or course_package_id\n";
echo "   └─────────┬───────┘\n";
echo "             │\n";
echo "   ┌─────────▼───────┐\n";
echo "   │ 3. Enroll Student│ ← Links student to batch via batch_user table\n";
echo "   │   in Batch      │\n";
echo "   └─────────┬───────┘\n";
echo "             │\n";
echo "   ┌─────────▼───────┐\n";
echo "   │ 4. Create Exams │ ← Links to batch for exam marks calculation\n";
echo "   └─────────┬───────┘\n";
echo "             │\n";
echo "   ┌─────────▼───────┐\n";
echo "   │ 5. Create Job   │ ← Links to same course via course_id\n";
echo "   │   Posting       │\n";
echo "   └─────────────────┘\n\n";

echo "2. API ENDPOINT:\n";
echo "   GET http://localhost:8000/api/job-postings/{job_posting_id}/eligible-student\n\n";

echo "3. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n";
echo "   ✓ Attendance: Minimum 75%\n";
echo "   ✓ Exam Marks: Minimum 60%\n";
echo "   ✓ Course Match: Student must be enrolled in batch with matching course\n\n";

echo "4. DATABASE TABLES INVOLVED:\n";
echo "   - courses (course information)\n";
echo "   - batches (batch information, linked to course)\n";
echo "   - batch_user (student-batch enrollment)\n";
echo "   - users (student information)\n";
echo "   - exams (exam information, linked to batch)\n";
echo "   - exam_attempts (student exam attempts and scores)\n";
echo "   - exam_questions (exam questions and scoring)\n";
echo "   - job_postings (job information, linked to course)\n";
echo "   - student_attendance (attendance records)\n\n";

echo "5. COMMON ISSUES:\n";
echo "   ❌ Student not enrolled in any batch\n";
echo "   ❌ Batch not linked to correct course\n";
echo "   ❌ Job posting course_id doesn't match batch course\n";
echo "   ❌ No exams created for the batch\n";
echo "   ❌ No exam attempts for student\n";
echo "   ❌ No attendance records for student\n\n";

echo "6. TESTING STEPS:\n";
echo "   a) Check if course exists: SELECT * FROM courses WHERE id = {course_id};\n";
echo "   b) Check if batch exists: SELECT * FROM batches WHERE course_id = {course_id} OR course_package_id = {course_id};\n";
echo "   c) Check student enrollment: SELECT * FROM batch_user WHERE user_id = {student_id};\n";
echo "   d) Check exams for batch: SELECT * FROM exams WHERE batch_id = {batch_id};\n";
echo "   e) Check exam attempts: SELECT * FROM exam_attempts WHERE student_id = {student_id};\n";
echo "   f) Check job posting: SELECT * FROM job_postings WHERE id = {job_posting_id};\n";
echo "   g) Test API: curl -X GET \"http://localhost:8000/api/job-postings/{job_posting_id}/eligible-student\"\n\n";

echo "7. DEBUGGING:\n";
echo "   - Check Laravel logs: tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log\n";
echo "   - API response includes detailed batch information\n";
echo "   - Course match reasons explain why students are/aren't eligible\n\n";

echo "8. EXAMPLE SQL QUERIES:\n";
echo "   -- Find all students enrolled in a specific course through batches\n";
echo "   SELECT DISTINCT u.id, u.name, u.email, c.name as course_name\n";
echo "   FROM users u\n";
echo "   JOIN batch_user bu ON u.id = bu.user_id\n";
echo "   JOIN batches b ON bu.batch_id = b.id\n";
echo "   JOIN courses c ON (b.course_id = c.id OR b.course_package_id = c.id)\n";
echo "   WHERE c.id = {course_id} AND u.role_id = 6;\n\n";

echo "   -- Find exams for a specific batch\n";
echo "   SELECT e.id, e.title, e.total_marks, b.name as batch_name\n";
echo "   FROM exams e\n";
echo "   JOIN batches b ON e.batch_id = b.id\n";
echo "   WHERE b.id = {batch_id};\n\n";

echo "   -- Find student exam attempts with scores\n";
echo "   SELECT ea.id, ea.score, ea.status, e.title as exam_title, e.total_marks\n";
echo "   FROM exam_attempts ea\n";
echo "   JOIN exams e ON ea.exam_id = e.id\n";
echo "   WHERE ea.student_id = {student_id} AND ea.status = 'completed';\n\n";

echo "   -- Find job postings for a specific course\n";
echo "   SELECT jp.id, jp.title, c.name as course_name\n";
echo "   FROM job_postings jp\n";
echo "   JOIN courses c ON jp.course_id = c.id\n";
echo "   WHERE c.id = {course_id};\n\n";

echo "=== End of Test Script ===\n";
